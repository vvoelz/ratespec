INSTALLATION

    REQUIRED PATHNAMES

    Please put the ratespec directory in your PYTHONPATH environment variable

    REQUIRED PACKAGES

    * You will need a working installation of scipy and numpy (see http://www.scipy.org/ )
    * For PlottingTools.py, an installation of matplotlib is required (see http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ )
    * For computing rate spectra via the Lasso (L1-norm regularization), the scikits-learn package of
      machine learning tools is needed (see http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/ )

    NOTE: all of these packaged can be installed together using the Enthought Python Distribution, which
    is *highly* recommended: http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php
